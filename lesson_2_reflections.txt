What are some situations when branches would be helpful

Ques: What is the result of merging two branches together?
Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

Ans: Addition to the original code before branching is kept
and the deletion to the original code is removed. The
representation in the diagram is to show that now on the two
branches have merged and they will follow one development path.

Ques: What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging
vs. always doing merges manually?
Ans: Merging manually allows us to to keep changes we want and
resolve conflicts when same part of code is modified by two or
more persons.
