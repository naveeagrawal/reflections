What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you 
need to do it?
It creates a .git directory in the specified directory 
which we want to track. To inform git to start working.

How is the staging area different from the working directory 
and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Working directory is where all our files used to exist. We
can use git 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful 
in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

One situation which I have in mind now is how can I develop

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Ans: We can clearly see the branch structure.

Ques: What is the result of merging two branches together?
Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

Ans: Addition to the original code before branching is kept
and the deletion to the original code is removed. The
representation in the diagram is to show that now on the two
branches have merged and they will follow one development path.
