What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you 
need to do it?
It creates a .git directory in the specified directory 
which we want to track. To inform git to start working.

How is the staging area different from the working directory 
and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Working directory is where all our files used to exist. We
can use git 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful 
in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

One situation which I have in mind now is how can I develop
two versions of my IWCF app, one paid version without ads
and another free version with ads.
