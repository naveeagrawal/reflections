When would you want to use a remote repository rather than 
keeping all your work local?
Ans: When I do not have access to my computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather 
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your 
remote repository?
Ans: As some changes we might not want to save.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?
Ans: Forks are copy of a repository on the GitHub. Clones are
copies of a repository on one machine to another or from the
GitHub to a computer. Branches are commit sequences starting
from a point in the commit history and following their own
path there after.
